A reimplementation of the legacy socket API, which replaces
 the underlying implementation used by the net.Socket and
 java.net.ServerSocket APIs with a simpler, more modern implementation
 that is easy to debug and maintain.
 The new implementation is intended to be easy to adapt
 to work with user-mode threads, also known as fibers,
 which are being explored in Project Loom.
